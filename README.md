# Data-Ingestion-using-PGvector-and-PDF
This repository demonstrates a data ingestion pipeline that extracts text from a PDF, splits it into chunks, generates vector embeddings using HuggingFace models, and stores the embeddings in PostgreSQL. It supports storing embeddings in both JSON and PGVector formats, enabling efficient search and retrieval based on vector similarity.
